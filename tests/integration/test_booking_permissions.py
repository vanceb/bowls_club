"""
Integration tests for booking-specific permission system.

Tests verify that:
1. Booking organizers can manage their own bookings
2. Booking organizers cannot access other bookings (unless they have Event Manager role)
3. Event Managers can access all bookings
4. Admin users can access all bookings
5. Regular users cannot access booking management
