# Pool-based Event Registration System - Essential Implementation Summary

## System Overview
Complete Pool → Teams → Bookings workflow for bowls club event management with role-based access control.

## Key Components Implemented

### 1. Database Models
- **EventPool**: Links events to pool functionality (`has_pool` flag, `is_open` status)
- **PoolRegistration**: Member registrations with status tracking (registered/available/selected/withdrawn)
- **Automatic pool creation**: New events get pools by default (open status)

### 2. User Workflow
1. **Members**: Register interest via "Upcoming Events" page
2. **Event Managers**: Manage pools, create teams from pool, create bookings
3. **Pool → Teams → Bookings**: Complete workflow with status tracking

### 3. Admin Interface Features
- **Event selection preserves context** (fixed redirect issues)
- **Pool status toggle**: Open/Close Registration buttons
- **Team editing shows only pool members** (not all users)
- **Add members to pool**: Event Managers can expand pools
- **Workflow progress indicators**: Visual status tracking

## Critical Fixes Applied

### Template & Route Issues
- **Fixed missing API endpoint**: Added proper role decorators for `/api/event/<id>`
- **Fixed template syntax errors**: Removed extra `{% endif %}` tags, safe DOM manipulation
- **Fixed context loss**: All team operations preserve event_id in redirects
- **Fixed CSRF token issues**: Proper form passing to templates

### Permission & Security
- **Role-based access**: `@role_required('Event Manager')` with admin bypass
- **Enhanced logging**: All actions logged to `instance/logs/app.log`
- **Input validation**: Proper form validation and error handling
- **XSS prevention**: Replaced `innerHTML` with safe DOM methods

### Data Filtering
- **Pool member filtering**: Team dropdowns show only pool registrations
- **Available member lists**: Exclude already registered members
- **Status-based queries**: Proper filtering by registration status

## Key Routes & Endpoints

### Admin Routes
- `/admin/manage_events?event_id=<id>` - Main event management interface
- `/admin/add_member_to_pool/<event_id>` - Expand pool membership
- `/admin/toggle_event_pool/<event_id>` - Open/close registration
- `/admin/edit_event_team/<team_id>` - Edit teams (pool members only)

### API Routes
- `/api/event/<event_id>` - Get event details (Event Manager access)
- `/api/events/upcoming` - Get pool-enabled events for members
- `/api/events/<id>/register` - Member pool registration
- `/api/events/<id>/withdraw` - Member withdrawal

### Member Routes
- `/upcoming_events` - View and register for events
- `/register_for_event` - Join event pool
- `/withdraw_from_event` - Leave event pool

## Configuration
- **CORE_ROLES**: Event Manager, User Manager, Content Manager
- **Auto pool creation**: All new events get pools (open by default)
- **Role hierarchy**: Admins bypass all role checks

## Security Features
- **CSRF protection**: All forms protected
- **Audit logging**: Complete action trail in `instance/logs/audit.log`
- **Role-based permissions**: Event Managers manage events, Users self-register
- **Input sanitization**: XSS prevention, safe templating

## Workflow Status Tracking
- **Pool Members**: Count of registered users
- **Available Members**: Ready for team selection  
- **Teams Created**: Template teams for bookings
- **Bookings Made**: Actual game bookings

## Error Handling & Logging
- **Enhanced error logging**: Full tracebacks to disk
- **User-friendly messages**: Clear feedback for all actions
- **Context preservation**: Errors maintain selected event state
- **Graceful degradation**: Fallback behaviors for missing data

## Database Consistency
- **Pool relationship checks**: Skip events with missing pool records
- **Status validation**: Proper enum handling for registration status
- **Cascade operations**: Safe deletion with booking preservation

## UI/UX Improvements
- **Responsive design**: Bulma CSS framework
- **Progress indicators**: Visual workflow status
- **Modal interactions**: Team and pool management
- **Form validation**: Client and server-side validation

This system provides complete pool-based event management with proper security, logging, and user experience.
